# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: April 26

**Today's Progress**: Watching the C# Streams and Data Processing lessons on Treehouse, working on my console Blackjack app, took a bunch of tech skills assessments on PluralSight.

**Thoughts:** I've seen #100DaysOfCode on here for a while, but yesterday I got a personal challenge from my full-stack instructor. 
So here we go.
There are certain things that I have trouble wrapping my head around, that I have just haven't gotten the "a-ha!" moment, including recursive functions, how to build C# classes without breaking the whole program, and just getting the hang of Visual Studio (I'm used to Atom).

### Day 1: April 27

**Today's Progress**: Serializing with JSON.Net in C#

**Thoughts:** This is giving me some ideas on how to build a sports or team app that can pull scores, records, etc.

### Day 2: April 28

**Today's Progress**: Breaking apart my BlackJack app, trying to figure out the best way to calculate the value of an Ace as a 1 or 11 without breaking the whole thing or writing spaghetti code

**Inspirational Quote:** 
There is freedom waiting for you on the breezes of the sky
And you ask, What if I fall?
Oh, but my darling, what if you fly?
